// 1: Create a 'Planet' component that renders a planet card

const Planet = (props) => {
  return (
    <div class="container">
      <div class="card">
        <div>
          <img src={props.url} alt="Mercury" />
        </div>
        <h2>{props.name}</h2>
        <p>{props.desc}</p>
        <h3>Planet Profile</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Diameter:</strong>
            {props.diameter}
          </li>

        </button>

//    and renders a 'Planet' component for each object in the array
